# Comparation between LinkedList and ArrayList

## Project's goal

This project has as goal measures the performance between LinkedList and ArrayList.
To colect the time I used the results of JUnit view.

## Result

There isn't a best the solution, because each class had better performance than another in different scenarios. Let's take a look.

**ArrayList**
> A good solution to iterates objects and access objects by index.

**LinkedList**
> A good solution when you need to insert objects in the middle of the list.

**Note!**
Although the insertion in different positions of the list has less discrepancy than populate and access by index, we need to consider that the tests complains just 100 insertions.
